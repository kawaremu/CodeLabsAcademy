    "# What is feature extraction?\n",
    "Feature selection is the process of reducing the number of input variables when developing a predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection methods are intended to reduce the number of input variables to those that are believed to be most useful to a model in order to predict the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is desirable to reduce the number of input variables to both reduce the computational cost of modeling and, in some cases, to improve the performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Some predictive modeling problems have a large number of variables that can slow the development and training of models and require a large amount of system memory. Additionally, the performance of some models can degrade when including input variables that are not relevant to the target variable.*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of feature selection techniques: supervised and unsupervised, and supervised methods may be divided into wrapper, filter and intrinsic.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of features :\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Useful features**: they provide more information and helps make our model more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Useless features** : they donâ€™t provide any useful information and might even deteriorate our model (They can be non helpful, false or duplicates).\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the right features is a crucial step to obtain an accurate model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main feature selection families :\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filter methods** : based on statistical tests. Filter-based feature selection methods use statistical measures to score the correlation or dependence between input variables that can be filtered to choose the most relevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wrapper methods** : generate all the possible combinations and create a model for each one and keep the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Embedded methods** : integrate the feature selection in the training process.\n"
